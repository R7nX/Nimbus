## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or later
- npm (included with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/R7nX/Nimbus.git
   cd Nimbus
   ```

2. Install all workspace dependencies from the repository root:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This installs dependencies for the frontend app in `nimbus/`, the backend API in `nimbus/server/`, and the root workspace tools.

3. Create a local backend environment file:
   ```bash
   cd nimbus/server
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   On PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   ```

### Running locally

Start the frontend and backend together from the repository root:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

The API runs at [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000) by default.

You can also run either side by itself from the repository root:
```bash
npm run dev:frontend
npm run dev:server
```

## Backend API

The backend API lives in `nimbus/server` and provides the foundation for future terminal sessions, WebSockets, files, auth, and user sessions.

## Workspace layout

The repository uses npm workspaces from the top-level `package.json`.

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `package.json` | Root workspace scripts for installing, running, and building both apps |
| `package-lock.json` | Single lockfile for all npm workspaces |
| `nimbus/package.json` | Frontend package manifest |
| `nimbus/server/package.json` | Backend API package manifest |

### Environment variables

The backend reads config from `nimbus/server/.env`.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | Runtime environment |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Host address for the API server |
| `PORT` | `4000` | Port for the API server |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | `http://localhost:3000` | Frontend origin allowed to call the API |

### Backend structure

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
