This is the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) frontend workspace for Nimbus.

The top-level repository has a root `package.json` that can install, run, and build both the frontend and backend together. This package still keeps its own `package.json` for frontend-specific scripts and dependencies.

## Getting Started

From the repository root, install all workspace dependencies:

```bash
cd C:\Nimbus
npm install
```

Then run the frontend and backend together:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To run only the frontend from the repository root:

```bash
npm run dev:frontend
```

You can also run frontend commands directly from this folder:

```bash
cd C:\Nimbus\nimbus
npm run dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Available Commands

From the repository root:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the frontend and backend together |
| `npm run dev:frontend` | Start only this Next.js frontend |
| `npm run build:frontend` | Build only this frontend |

From `C:\Nimbus\nimbus`:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Next.js development server |
| `npm run build` | Build the frontend for production |
| `npm run start` | Start the production frontend after a build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |

## Backend API

The backend API lives in `C:\Nimbus\nimbus\server`. When both apps are running, the API health check is available at [http://127.0.0.1:4000/health](http://127.0.0.1:4000/health).

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
