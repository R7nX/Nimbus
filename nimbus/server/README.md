This is a [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) API service for Nimbus.

The server provides the backend foundation for future terminal sessions, WebSockets, files, auth, and user sessions. The current API exposes a health check route and loads runtime config from environment variables.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a local environment file from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

On PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The API starts at [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000) by default.

## Health Check

Check that the server is running:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:4000/health
```

On PowerShell:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:4000/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "nimbus-api",
  "uptime": 12.34
}
```

## Environment Variables

The server reads config from `.env`.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | Runtime environment |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Host address for the API server |
| `PORT` | `4000` | Port for the API server |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | `http://localhost:3000` | Frontend origin allowed to call the API |

The `ws` folder is reserved for terminal streaming work. Terminal sessions are not implemented yet.

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the API server with watch mode |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript into `dist/` |
| `npm run start` | Run the compiled server from `dist/` |
